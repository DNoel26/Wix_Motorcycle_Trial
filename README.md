## Summary
This project was intended to be a pixel for pixel clone of a chosen Wix site template and was built from scratch using only HTML and CSS, no JavaScript. It is designed to showcase my ability to look at a design and execute it accordingly. It is currently hosted on Netlify and can be accessed via the link here: https://dnoelmotorcyclewixclone.netlify.app/
